# SPEC CPU2017 Command Lines

The SPEC CPU2017 Benchmark Suite, comprising of 43 benchmarks, focuses on characterizing a system's compute-intensive performance (CPU, memory hierarchy, and compilers). The benchmarks need to be executed using SPEC's '*runcpu*' utility for generating reportable results. However, it's not possible to execute individual benchmark-input pair using any of the SPEC's utilities. This document provides the command lines for all the benchmark-input pairs of the SPEC CPU2017 Benchmark Suite to run them individually. The following command lines for benchmarks were obtained using the '*specinvoke -n*' command in the appropriate run directories.
